## Deploying Applications on AWS: EC2 vs ECS vs EKS

When it comes to deploying applications on AWS, one common question is:
EC2, ECS, or Kubernetes (EKS)?

At a high level, all three help run applications — but the level of abstraction and responsibility differs.

How to think about them:
▪️ EC2 → We manage servers, OS, runtime, and the application.
▪️ ECS → We focus on containers while AWS handles orchestration.
▪️ EKS → We work at the Kubernetes level, managing pods and services.

💡 Key takeaway:
Each option abstracts infrastructure differently, but all rely on the same core cloud concepts — compute, networking, security, and scalability.
▪️ Understanding these differences helps in:
▪️ Choosing the right deployment model
▪️ Designing scalable architectures
▪️ Making better DevOps and cloud decisions
