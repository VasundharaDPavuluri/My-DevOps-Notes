Here are some Linux basics 🐧 that every DevOps enthusiast should remember:
▪️ Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in DevOps.
▪️ The file system is structured like a tree (/ is the root).
▪️ Everything in Linux is treated as a file (even devices).
▪️ Linux is case-sensitive → File.txt and file.txt are different.
▪️ Important directories to know:
 ▫️ /home → user files
 ▫️ /etc → configuration files
 ▫️ /var → logs & variable data
 ▫️ /bin → essential binaries

💡 Why this matters:
 Almost every DevOps tool (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, etc.) runs on Linux. Having clarity on these basics makes it easier to understand commands, servers, and automation later.
