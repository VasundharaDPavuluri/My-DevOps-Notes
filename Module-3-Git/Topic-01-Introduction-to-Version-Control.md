# Module-3: Git
## Topic-1: Introduction to Version Control Systems (VCS)

---

## 1. What is Version Control?
Version Control is a system that helps track changes made to files over time.  
It allows multiple people to work on the same project without conflicts and helps restore previous versions when needed.

In simple terms, it answers:
- Who made the change?
- What changed?
- When was it changed?
- Why was it changed?

---

## 2. Why Version Control is Important

### Without Version Control:
- Files get overwritten
- No history of changes
- Difficult collaboration
- Risk of losing work

### With Version Control:
- Complete history of changes
- Easy collaboration
- Backup and recovery
- Parallel development using branches

---

## 3. Types of Version Control Systems

### 3.1 Local Version Control
- Files are stored locally
- Manual tracking of versions
- Not suitable for teams

**Example:**  
Saving files as `project_v1`, `project_v2`

---

### 3.2 Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
- Single central server
- Developers pull and push changes
- Requires network connection

**Examples:**
- SVN
- CVS

**Limitations:**
- Single point of failure
- Slower collaboration

---

### 3.3 Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
- Every developer has a full copy of the repository
- Works offline
- Faster and more reliable

**Examples:**
- Git
- Mercurial

---

## 4. Why Git?
Git is the most popular Distributed Version Control System.

### Key Reasons:
- Very fast
- Lightweight
- Strong branching & merging
- Works offline
- Open source
- Industry standard

## 5. Git vs Other VCS

| Feature | Centralized VCS | Git (DVCS) |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Repository | Central server only | Local + remote |
| Offline work | Not possible | Possible |
| Speed | Slower | Very fast |
| Backup | Single point of failure | Multiple copies |

## 6. Git in DevOps
Git plays a crucial role in DevOps by enabling:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Collaboration between teams
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Automated deployments
- Versioning of scripts and configurations

---

## 7. Summary
- Version control tracks changes
- Git is a distributed version control system
- Git enables collaboration, speed, and reliability
- Git is a foundation skill for DevOps engineers
