## 🚀 Multi-Stage Docker Builds — Shrinking Images from GBs to MBs

Most production Docker images are bigger than they need to be.

They often ship with:
* Compilers
* Build tools
* Source code
* SDKs
* OS utilities

But production only needs the runtime + artifact.

That’s wasted space, slower pipelines, and a larger attack surface.

### 🔹 What is a Multi-Stage Build?

A Docker feature that uses multiple `FROM` statements in one Dockerfile.

Stage 1 → Build the application
Final Stage → Copy only runtime artifacts

Result:
✅ Smaller images
✅ More secure containers
✅ Cleaner Dockerfiles

Build in one stage → copy the artifact → run in a minimal image.

### 🔹 Example (Java)

Build stage contains Maven + JDK + source
Runtime stage contains only JRE + JAR

Image reduced:
~700MB ➝ ~120MB

Because we removed everything not required for execution.

### 🔹 Real System Scenario

Traditional approach (seen often earlier):

Ubuntu base

* Java
* React
* MySQL
* Build tools
* Entrypoints

➡ Image size explodes to 1–1.5GB

Using Multi-Stage:

Build stage → full environment
Runtime stage → slim runtime

Final image:
~150MB

You can create **N stages**, but only the last stage becomes the image.

### 🔹 Distroless Images

Next level optimization.

A distroless image contains:
✔ Application
✔ Runtime

And nothing else.

No shell
No package manager
No OS tools

This drastically reduces:
• CVEs
• Attack surface
• Debug exposure

Example (Go):
959MB ➝ 3.18MB

That’s not an improvement — that’s a transformation.

### 🔹 Production Lesson Learned

In one project we found:

Images built on Ubuntu runtime layers
Multiple CVEs detected
Large registry costs
Slow CI/CD

We redesigned using:
Multi-stage builds
Distroless runtime images

Outcome:
✔ Image sizes dropped significantly
✔ Faster pipeline execution
✔ Reduced vulnerabilities
✔ Improved startup time

### 🔹 Interview One-Liner

“We reduced Docker image size and vulnerabilities by moving from Ubuntu-based images to multi-stage builds with distroless runtimes, removing build tools and OS layers from production.”

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaway

Containers are not VMs.
Ship only what runs — nothing else.

Multi-stage builds are not an optimization trick.
They’re a production engineering standard.
